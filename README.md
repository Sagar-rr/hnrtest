This project has total two pages first page is Home Page and second is Profile page.

1.Home Page ->
	- This page shows list of users. at a time only six users are shown on screen.
	  Assumption made -> I have assumed that api is giving only six users per page.
        - On header of this page there is provision for search and sort.
	  - Search option use to search user by it,s full name.
	  - Sort button sorts user list alphabatically in ascennding order.	
        - Footer of this page contains two buttons 'Next' and 'Prev' on footer to navigate through users list.

1.Profile Page ->  
	-Here user can Change his profile picture.
	- User need to click on 'Change Picture' button. then device camera will be open, user can capture image
	  then crop it in rectangular shape using default image crop application.
	  Note: image will be converted to 128px*128px and then displayed in the app in circular placeholder
